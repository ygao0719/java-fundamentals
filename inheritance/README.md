create classes and interfaces to represent reviews of restaurants
Create a Shop class; a Shop should have a name, description, and number of dollar signs.
Create a Theater class; a Theater should have a name and all of the movies currently showing there

You can review restaurant, shop and theater. When you review theater, you have the opition to tell me what movies you watched.
